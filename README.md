You can select multiple files on the list. If at least one file is selected, delete button(red dash icon) will be clickable.

If some of files you want to add already exist in the list, Notice dialog will pop up to show you which files exist in the list. If you click OK, it will add files which are not duplicated. Otherwise none of files you want to add will be on the list.

## Note

I'm currently working with "Don't ask again" feature. Hope you don't mind. 

Well, One more thing. Duplicated files notice dialog's "show file name only" is not properly connected with main file list widget. I'm currently working with this too.
